# Module 5 Azure.

#### Homework: 
* 1. Create VNet, VM, Loadbalancer, IIS server via Azure Portal.
* 2. Create IIS server via ARM template.
* 3. Change IIS default start page (ARM template or custom script).


##### 5.1.1. Create VNet.

Create resource group "vnet_resource" and virtual network "vnet_for_hw".

##### 5.1.3. Create Loadbalancer.

Create in resource group "Win" LoadBalancer "LB".<br>
In the other tabs, do not change anything. <br>
The numbers in the names of the created tools do not match, because the tools have already been created earlier and work correctly.

Create VM "Win2" in same region as LB. <br>
I could not choose "Size" at the moment, because there were no VM available in this region.

Configure network connections.

Configure LB on the same tab. <br>
Create server pool "pool_test2".

Connect to our VM "Win2". <br>
For install IIS in Power Shell run command <br>
    
    Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools

_________

Ð¡ontinue to configure LB. <br>
Create Health probes "Zond_test".

Create Load balancing rules "RuleforLB".

![something going wrong](./images/image5.1.3_6.PNG)

Check our configurations. <br>
Enter to IP VM (52.148.150.117) and IP LB (52.143.83.234).
