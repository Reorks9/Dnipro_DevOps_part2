##### 5.1.3. Create Loadbalancer.

Create in resource group "Win" LoadBalancer "LB".<br>
In the other tabs, do not change anything. <br>
The numbers in the names of the created tools do not match, because the tools have already been created earlier and work correctly.

Create VM "Win2" in same region as LB. <br>
I could not choose "Size" at the moment, because there were no VM available in this region.
