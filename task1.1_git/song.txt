Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)
ABBA

FIRST HALF ...

Half past twelve
Watchin' the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds blowin' outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day
